# Timelogger

## Getting API to work (MS-SQL is required)
1. You might have to change the connection string in appsetting.json 
2. Goto Package Manager Console and type Update-Database

## Getting client to work
1. Extract node_modules.zip into client folder

## My workflow
It has been quite a quest to get where I am now. I’m still a bit from being done with the Time logger. It has been my first time ever working with WebAPIs and React. It was particularly challenging to get data to and from the API and React. Unfortunately, I used a database instead of memory database, in the frontend, I used JavaScript instead of TypeScript, mostly because I had issues. You must know that I will first learn “React”, “WebAPIs” and “Unit testing” in school in about two years. I have tried my best getting something to work.
